###Updates
---
This particular project is scheduled for multiple small updates between the dates of 4-5-21 and 4-12-21.

###Description
---
In the early 16th century the Spanish explorer and conquistador Francisco Coronado embarked on a legendary journey across the Southwestern
United States.  His journey took him through many amazing geographical wonders which you can explore here in this interactive website.  Do
you dislike European explorers?  Replace his name with yours (but keep the handsome picture).  You can also choose to like certain locations
and ignore others.

All of these actions are available to you through basic javascript concepts such as defining variables, adding event listeners, and loops.

###Deployment

This webpage is offered in English only.  It should be accessible and has been formatted to appear as intended in most browsers
without significant issues.

# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
